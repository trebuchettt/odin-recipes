<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Stir and mix all the beginning ingredients in a bowl, toss it into a preheated oven, wait 15, turn it, wait 15, bing bong, you've got pizza(dough)! </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup whole weat flour</li>
    <li>3 cups all-prupose flour></li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
    <li>all-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Stir whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, salt, sugar, olive oil, and warm water with a spatula until formed into a sticky ball of dough that pulls away from sides of a large bowl, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with a light cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) for 18 hours, until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F (280 degrees C). Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and sprinkle with more flour. Form the dough into a rectangle, and cut it into four equal parts. Shape each piece into a ball, stretching and tucking the dough to create a smooth surface, adding more flour if needed. Cover the dough balls with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>To shape the dough, sprinkle the surface with flour and lightly pat flat. Use a rolling pin to form a thin disk about 9 inches in diameter.</li>
    <li>Transfer the formed crust to the prepared baking sheet and top as desired. Bake on the bottom rack for 4 minutes, move to the middle rack and bake for 5-6 minutes more minutes, until the bottom is crispy and the top is lightly browned. Move to cooling rack to cool slightly before serving.</li>
